# Trading Bot Optimization Summary

## Key Findings from WANDB and Testing

### 1. WANDB Hyperparameter Sweep Results
- **Optimal Chunk Size**: 150 candles (consistently best across all tests)
- **Leverage**: 15-20x showed good results, but 12-15x is safer
- **Position Size**: 15-24% of balance worked well
- **Stop Loss**: 1.5-2.7% range
- **Take Profit**: 2.5-4.5% range

### 2. Testing Results Comparison

| Bot Version | Return | Trades | Win Rate | Profit Factor | Key Issue |
|-------------|--------|--------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Original Optimized | -16.86% | 1 | 0% | 0.00 | Too restrictive |
| Balanced | +9.86% | 172 | 40.1% | 1.01 | Best performer |
| Refined | -27.95% | 124 | 21.8% | 0.72 | Over-optimized |
| Final | -0.21% | 4 | 25.0% | 0.97 | Too conservative |

### 3. Key Learnings

#### What Works:
- **Balanced approach**: Not too strict, not too loose
- **Moderate leverage**: 12-15x provides good risk/reward
- **Reasonable position sizing**: 12-15% of balance
- **Wider take profits**: 3.5-4.0% works better than tight 2.5%
- **Volume confirmation**: 1.4-1.6x average volume
- **RSI filtering**: Avoid extreme overbought/oversold

#### What Doesn't Work:
- **Over-optimization**: Too many filters reduce trade frequency to near zero
- **High leverage**: 20x+ creates excessive risk
- **Tight stops**: <1.5% stop loss gets hit too often
- **Signal quality scoring**: Added complexity without benefit
- **Consecutive loss limiting**: Reduces profitable opportunities

### 4. Optimal Parameter Set (From Balanced Bot)
```python
{
    'leverage': 15,
    'position_size_pct': 0.15,        # 15%
    'stop_loss_pct': 0.020,           # 2.0%
    'take_profit_pct': 0.035,         # 3.5%
    'chunk_size': 150,
    'momentum_threshold': 0.002,
    'volume_multiplier': 1.4
}
```

### 5. Performance Metrics
- **Target Return**: 10-20% on historical data
- **Target Win Rate**: 35-45%
- **Target Profit Factor**: >1.0
- **Target Trade Frequency**: 0.5-1.0% of candles
- **Max Drawdown**: <$500 on $1000 starting balance

### 6. Real-Time Implementation Considerations
- **Network connectivity**: Fallback to REST API when WebSocket fails
- **Windows compatibility**: Use synchronous requests to avoid async issues
- **Risk management**: Position sizing based on account balance
- **Continuous learning**: WANDB integration for ongoing optimization

### 7. Next Steps for Live Trading
1. Use the **Balanced Bot parameters** as the baseline
2. Implement real-time data collection with fallbacks
3. Add position sizing based on actual account balance
4. Include slippage and fee calculations
5. Add emergency stop mechanisms
6. Monitor performance and adjust parameters monthly

### 8. WANDB Integration Benefits
- **Hyperparameter optimization**: Found optimal chunk size and parameters
- **Performance tracking**: Detailed metrics and visualization
- **Experiment comparison**: Easy to compare different approaches
- **Continuous improvement**: Ongoing optimization with new data

## Conclusion
The **Balanced Optimized Bot** with 15x leverage, 15% position size, 2% stop loss, and 3.5% take profit achieved the best results with +9.86% return and reasonable trade frequency. This represents the sweet spot between profitability and practical trading frequency.
