## Critical Insights

### ‚úÖ What Works
1. **Time-based chunking** significantly outperforms other methods
2. **Bullish BOS signals** are reliable with 39.6% win rate
3. **Larger chunk sizes** (150 vs 75 candles) perform better
4. **6-12 hour time windows** capture natural market cycles

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work
1. **Signal-based chunking** performs terribly (-$260 loss)
2. **Bearish signals** are unreliable (23% win rate for BOS, 0% for CHOCH)
3. **Small chunk sizes** increase noise and reduce performance
4. **CHOCH signals** should be avoided entirely

### üîç Market Behavior Analysis
- **Bullish bias**: Market shows strong upward momentum during this period
- **Signal quality**: BOS signals are much more reliable than CHOCH
- **Timeframe sensitivity**: 3-minute data benefits from longer aggregation periods
- **Volatility impact**: Higher volatility strategies can be profitable but risky

## Recommendations

### üöÄ For Live Trading
1. **Use 6-12 hour time windows** for backtesting and strategy validation
2. **Focus on Bullish BOS signals** - avoid bearish signals in trending markets
3. **Implement position sizing** - reduce size on bearish signals if used
4. **Consider market regime** - this analysis shows bullish market conditions

### üìà For Strategy Optimization
1. **Test different stop-loss/take-profit ratios** for bullish signals
2. **Add trend filters** to improve bearish signal reliability
3. **Implement dynamic position sizing** based on signal strength
4. **Consider longer timeframes** (5m, 15m) for more stable signals

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management
1. **High volatility warning**: Time-based strategies show 9.54% volatility
2. **Drawdown potential**: Worst chunk showed -8.96% loss
3. **Signal reliability**: Only 37.3% win rate even for best strategy
4. **Market dependency**: Results may not generalize to different market conditions
